    "Create Occupancy Grid Based on Free Space Estimation\n",
    "Occupancy grids are used to represent a vehicle's surroundings as a discrete grid in vehicle coordinates and are used for path planning. Each cell in the occupancy grid has a value representing the probability of the occupancy of that cell. The estimated free space can be used to fill in values of occupancy grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure to fill the occupancy grid using the free space estimate is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the dimensions of the occupancy grid in vehicle coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a set of (X,Y) points for each grid cell. These points are in the vehicle's coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform the points from the vehicle coordinate space (X,Y) into the bird's-eye-view image coordinate space (x,y) using the vehicleToImage transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample the free space confidence values at (x,y) locations using griddedInterpolant to interpolate free space confidence values that are not exactly at pixel centers in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill the occupancy grid cell with the average free space confidence value for all (x,y) points that correspond to that grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity, the procedure shown above is implemented in the supporting function, createOccupancyGridFromFreeSpaceEstimate, which is listed at the end of this example. Define the dimensions of the occupancy grid in terms of the bird's-eye-view configuration and create the occupancy grid by calling createOccupancyGridFromFreeSpaceEstimate."
